## 2019-05-20

These weekly documents serve as a working journal. This week is (a bit) trivial; I suggest that the reader skip directly to [week 2](2019-05-27-week-02.md).

### Rclone

I set up `rclone` to push/pull large files from the team google drive.

- <https://rclone.org/drive/>
- <https://www.chpc.utah.edu/documentation/software/rclone.php>

I found out that importing/exporting Google documents with rclone is lossy, e.g., the edit history shows a complete revision whether I change a single character or a couple of paragraphs. I have decided it'd be best to view/edit these documents in a browser. 

- <https://rclone.org/drive/#import-export-of-google-documents>

Here's my pull script, with '--drive-export-formats link.html' configured to *link* to google documents rather than *converting and downloading* the files. 

```bash
to_sync="$(readlink -f .)"/ 
google_drive_dir="$(readlink -f /home/colton/fy/20/sia)"*/
options="-v -u\
    --checkers 1\
    --transfers 4\
    --drive-export-formats link.html\
    --fast-list"

case $to_sync
    in $google_drive_dir)
        rclone sync $options "sia-remote:${to_sync#$google_drive_dir}" "$to_sync" #--dry-run 
    ;; esac
```

The rule of thumb with the above script is that: if the file has an extension, then I am working with it locally; else it's a google document and I will make changes in a browser.

Here's my push script, configured to ignore `html` files and google documents.

```bash
to_sync="$(readlink -f .)"/
google_drive_dir="$HOME/fy/20/sia"
options="-v -u\
    --checkers 1\
    --transfers 4\
    --drive-skip-gdocs\
    --fast-list
    --exclude-from $google_drive_dir/.exclude"

case $to_sync
    in $google_drive_dir*)
        rclone sync $options "$to_sync" "sia-remote:${to_sync#$google_drive_dir*}" # --dry-run
    ;; esac
```

I have to ignore google documents for the push, else rclone would sync my local directory and delete the remote documents from the team google drive.

### Plaintext

I have chosen to leave my notes and updates as `.txt` files in the google drive. The syntax of these notes will be in pandoc markdown, so that I might later have the option to compile these notes into a blog post or a jupyter notebook. 

As well, google drive can display text files in the browser. There are a few drive extensions (notepad?) that can natively edit text files without converting them to google documents. 

I hope primarily to write in markdown/plaintex during the 11 weeks, both to prepare updates for team meetings, and to start documenting whatever source code.

### Version control

- <https://github.com/coltongrainger/fy20siparcs>

- The `fy20` prefix to `siparcs` indicates this repository was created in the *fiscal year 2020*, which began for me somewhere around 2019-05-11.
