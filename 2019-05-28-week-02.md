## 2019-05-28

Today I stumbled into Gil Compo's publication list at <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/people/gilbert.p.compo/publications.html>. I skimmed the following:

1. Allan, Rob, Gil Compo, and Jim Carton. “Recovery of Global Surface Weather Observations for Historical Reanalyses and International Users.” Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union 92, no. 18 (2011): 154–154. https://doi.org/10.1029/2011EO180008.

    - To list large ACRE datasets (on a 150-year timescale): ISPD (surface pressure), **ICOADS**, and 20CR (this isn't really a dataset, but rather a reanalysis?).

    - Our historical weather data is *only* being pushed to ICOADS.

    - 2010 UNFCC SBSTA mandate: rescue data, digitize historical observations, coordinate international initiatives.

    - RDA will host maritime log books (documentary climate data) with observations in two critical regions: the tropics and the arctic.

        - (Brohan and Wood would like NCAR's RDA to host a redundant copies to avoid agency siloing between USFG agencies presently archiving the images.)

    - Unifying goal: there needs to be a *functional*, *transparent*, and *robust* correspondence between documentary climate data and climate reanalyses.

2. Compo, G. P., J. S. Whitaker, P. D. Sardeshmukh, N. Matsui, R. J. Allan, X. Yin, B. E. Gleason, et al. “The Twentieth Century Reanalysis Project.” Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society 137, no. 654 (2011): 1–28. https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.776.

3. Stickler, Alexander, Samuel Storz, Richard Wartenburger, Hans Hersbach, Gilbert P. Compo, Paul Poli, Dick Dee, and Stefan Brönnimann. “Upper-Air Observations from the German Atlantic Expedition (1925–27) and Comparison with the Twentieth Century and ERA-20C Reanalyses.” Meteorologische Zeitschrift, August 31, 2015, 525–44. https://doi.org/10.1127/metz/2015/0683.

    - IGRA2 data formats from c. 1957 radiosonde networks.

    - In passing, Steve Worley mentioned that the name of a dataset, the date range, the genre (format) of the data, and the parameters (e.g., meteorological observation types) would serve as a minimal metadata schema.

    - Asked Tom about accessing NCAR's historical upper-air database, perhaps as a template for our meta-data schema. Tom mentioned this dataset is exceptional, a point also made by Stickler et al.: marine upper-air observations are rare, and the *Meteor*'s voyage 1925-'27 is *not* of the same class as the observations we should expect from the Wood/Brohan's historical ship logs.

    - Near surface marine observations are (?) made in a range of [-10m, 10m] from sea level.

        - But this range varies with the vessel type, e.g., ships, bouys, ports, miscellaneous vessels, sail drones

    - However, Tom and I were led to distinguish three user groups for rda image archive: 
        
        - Citizen scientists responsible for digitizing/reducing meterological data from .tiff files.
        - ICOADS developers, among other scientists "operating" on datasets prior to the dataset's use as observational data to diff against model outputs for climate reanalyses.
        - Scientists searching for climate trends, who, upon encountering *extreme*, *exceptional*, or *misleading* data, need to cross-reference the .tiff files for "ground truth validation".

    - Some

Department of Commerce. “International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS) Release 3, Individual Observations,” May 9, 2016. https://doi.org/10.5065/D6ZS2TR3.

    - ICOADS provides "periodic constraints" for climate models.

    - (Tom summarized that sea ice and sea temp boundary conditions are set by other models, our contribution will be to provide *observations* for interpolation, rather than *boundary conditions.* I'm confused about the difference, but it's immaterial to my project for the next 10 weeks.)

5. Polavarapu, Saroja. “PHY 2509: Atmospheric Data Assimilation,” 2004. http://www.atmosp.physics.utoronto.ca/PHY2509/.

    - Conversely, as a use case for the *reduced* historical weather data (*not* the images) Tom mentioned Dave Berry (?), Elizabeth Kent (?) searching for biases by diffing observational datasets against model outputs. Polavarapu describes *data assimilation* just as so: weighing model outputs again observation data. 

        - Data assimilation is at the intersection of stochastic processes, signal processing, and time series analyses. 

        - Data assimilation requires, broadly, *filtering and interpolation*. Modern reanalysis systems are *variational*, including `3DVAR`, `4DVAR`, and `EnKF`. 

        - One handles underdeterminacy (on a relative scale of ~75 unknown states for each observation) by *sampling prior data*.

    - Potentially a metadata framework.

8. NCAR's historical upper-air dataset `glade/collections/rda/data/ds370.11`.

    - ASCII files in GLADE.
    - Primary copy in HPSS.

    - Scraped [abbreviations](/2019-05-28-major-abbreviations-and-terms.md) from appendix A.

10. Here's a random question, which I overhead in the library while Natasha Flyer <https://staff.ucar.edu/users/flyer> was lecturing her postdoc: what order of (differentiable) approximation can one obtain from a nearest neighbour stiple with 31 points? (Did I hear incorrectly?)

### 2019-05-29

Today I intended to complete the following tasks.

1. Determine what Wood and Brohan want from metadata.
    - Focus on issues with SQuo storage of images in National Archives.
    - Unpack NARA_Master_Manifest.

2. Bulk download image samples to `/glade/collections/rda/work/image_archive`.

3. Initialize mySQL test database; establish UIDs for images.

For 1--2, I loaded the NARA_Master_Manifest as `csv` files and went through Jake VanderPlas's tutorial for munging data with the python package `pandas` (similar to `numpy`). I anticipate scripting my bulk downloads in pandas/numpy, then injecting the "clean" metadata DataFrames into mySQL, one table for each point of metadata. This tutorial is presently hosted at <https://github.com/coltongrainger/fy20pandas>, forked from [Monte Lunacek](https://github.com/mlunacek) at NREL. (He presented at RMACC 2019.)

I made no progress on 3, though I am working in pandas under the assumption that stable URLs will *initially* be a nightmare to coordinate.

I also consolidated my *all* my notes from SIParCS under the repo <https://github.com/coltongrainger/fy20siparcs>.
